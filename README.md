# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a complete **Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project on the Titanic Dataset**, done as part of a Data Science learning journey. It explores survival factors using Python, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implements classification models to predict survival.

## 📊 Objective

To analyze the Titanic passenger dataset to:

- Understand key factors that influenced survival
- Perform data cleaning and feature engineering
- Visualize meaningful insights
- Build machine learning models to predict survival

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Gender Distribution**: Analyzed the impact of gender on survival.
- **Age Distribution**: Checked survival trends across age groups.
- **Class Comparison**: Compared survival rate based on class (`Pclass`).
- **Correlation Analysis**: Checked correlation heatmap of numerical features.
- **Missing Value Handling**: Filled missing data using appropriate methods.

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

- Converted categorical variables like `Sex`, `Embarked` into numeric.
- Filled missing `Age` and `Embarked` values.
- Created new features like `FamilySize` and `IsAlone`.

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Both models were trained and tested, and their accuracy compared.

## 📈 Results

| Model           | Accuracy Score |
|----------------|----------------|
| Decision Tree  | ✅    80.0 %     |
| KNN            | ✅    82.67 %      |
